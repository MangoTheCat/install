    Found the following significant warnings:
      Warning: 'BiocInstaller' and 'biocLite()' are deprecated, use the 'BiocManager' CRAN
    See ‘.../revdep/checks.noindex/BiocInstaller/new/BiocInstaller.Rcheck/00install.out’ for details.
    ```

*   checking whether the namespace can be loaded with stated dependencies ... NOTE
    ```
    Warning: 'BiocInstaller' and 'biocLite()' are deprecated, use the 'BiocManager' CRAN
      package instead.
    
    A namespace must be able to be loaded with just the base namespace
    loaded: otherwise if the namespace gets loaded by a saved object, the
    session will be unable to start.
    
    Probably some imports need to be declared in the NAMESPACE file.
    ```

*   checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
    ```
    'library' or 'require' call to ‘utils’ in package code.
      Please use :: or requireNamespace() instead.
      See section 'Suggested packages' in the 'Writing R Extensions' manual.
    Unexported object imported by a ':::' call: ‘utils:::.clean_up_dependencies’
      See the note in ?`:::` about the use of this operator.
    There are ::: calls to the package's namespace in its code. A package
      almost never needs to use ::: for its own objects:
      ‘.updateBiocInstallerFinish’ ‘.updateFinish’
